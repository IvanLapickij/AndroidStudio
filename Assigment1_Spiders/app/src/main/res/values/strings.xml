        More than 43,000 different species
        of spiders are found in the world.
        Of these, only a small number are
        said to be dangerous, and less than
        30 (less than one-tenth of one percent)
        have been responsible for human
        deaths. Why are so few spiders harmful
        to humans? Much of the reason may
        result from the size differences between
        people and spiders. Spider
        venom is designed to work on smaller animals,
        but the venom of some
        species can produce skin lesions in people or
        produce allergic reactions
        that result in fatalities. It is important to
        understand, however, that
        “death by spider bite” is very rare since clinics,
        poison control centers
        , and hospitals often have various
        species-specificantivenin
        (the antitoxin) on hand to treat the bite.
